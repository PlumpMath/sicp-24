Lisp Is a Sanskrit Parallel
==========

# Hello, World!

The sensational title of this essay intends to trigger your interest (in whatever form - astonishment, ridicule, outrage or mirth) and then hopefully cause your intellect to critically evaluate the idea "Lisp Is a Sanskrit Parallel".

# Preface

The Insight is perhaps blindingly obvious to some, who may go as far as to say IT is not just a language but a complete general-purpose framework for all knowledge processing. That IT will startle those who happen to cross ITs path, like I seem to have. And I am certain many who have read thus far have percieved the idea, of IT being so, to be mildly humourous or a bit more than mildly speculative if not riotous hearsay or even blind faith. [1]

But I propose that neither should this be unique in the sense that it may only be available to and owned by a few bestowed, purely by random selection, with amazing psychic abilities, nor should it be relegated to be an article of faith. For it is apparent, at least at my current level of understanding, that the set of Ideas leading to the Insight can bear independant analytical scrutiny on _at least_ the following fronts: linguistic, logical, empirical, and philosophical.

# Analytical Context

The attempt is to open door to further analysis by first _stating_ some direct parallels between the world of Lisp and that of Sanskrit, and then to try and _demonstrate_ the parallels by comparing some readings from one of the Vedas and a platinum-standard Computer Science text.

But before I proceed, I will take liberty to reproduce a Vedic shloka [2]:
 > Yukti-yuktam vacho grahyam bala-dapi shuka-dapi|
 > Yukti-hinam vachas-tyajyam vrudha-dapi shuka-dapi|| [3]

 > i.e. whatever is consistent with the right reasoning should be accepted, even though it comes from a boy or even from a parrot; and whatever is inconsistent therewith ought to be rejected, although emanating from an old man or even from the great sage, Sri Suka himself. [4]

So I hope even though I am the boy or the parrot of the above shloka, you, dear world, will find enough merit in the Insight to examine the following observations more critically than presented here or, dare one say, to engage in the sort of study that will far transcend the extremely nascent understanding of things that generated this essay - particularly Lisp and Sanskrit as computational media.

# Philosopy

Trivially, while Lisp has its philosophical roots in the Artifical Intelligence community's desire to create thinking machines, Sanskrit is rooted in the Vedic desire to systematically and progressively assimilate *all* of human knowledge, make it universally accessible and fully manipulable by organic human means alone.

But in a more general context, anyone who wants to find a way to manage and control complexity at all scales with computers will sooner or later converge at language standards like those of Lisp and if one wants to achieve it mentally, one will converge towards language standards like those of Sanskrit.

Note my emphasis on language standards as opposed to language implementataion or script by itself.

Complexity at all scales means, first of all, we don't know a whole lot of things, past, present or future, and in all likelihood we don't know a whole lot about the things that we do know of, but we still need some way to control and manage it. In short, we must have a way to deal with an unbounded number and variety of situations. So the system we attempt to create to this end must be rooted in some fundamental principles that then allow us to create virtually unlimited varieties of powerful abstractions. Furthermore, these principles must be open to modification, but only if and when some fundamental new fact causes us to change our understanding of how to deal with complexity.

It turns out there are many, very fundamental, ideas common to both worlds, including, as far as one currently understands; Succinctness, Expressiveness, Procedural Abstraction, Dynamic Typing, Run-time Interpretation, Macros, and clarity about Declarative versus Imperative knowledge.

# Parallel but not Equal

Lisps are to Hardware what Sanskrit is to Wetware. This basic difference in operating environment is reason for several variations in specific language standards as well as actual language implementation.

Just like Lisp machines can exist, with Lisp-everything, right from the UI down to bare metal, human knowledge processors can exist with Sanskrit-everything. Sanskrit learning wires directly into our neural networks and is accessible as an audio-visual motive-emotive physical-mental input/output user interface.

While the examples to appear later will only show parallels in terms of Mathemeatics, Sanskrit is said to be a fully general-purpose (programmable programming) language for knowledge procesing in all fields of human understanding.

# Why not say Sanskrit is Lisp?
Programming static Electronic Machines versus Dynamic Multi-sensory Wetware
It may be more appropriate to say Lisp is a dialect of Sanskrit.

I believe it can further be empirically demonstrated by observing a special case of computation, that is mathematical computation, using procedures that are generated by both languages.

And I am certain there are several learned members of the computer science community who have already seen the connection and who will be able to critically evaluate the insight better than I, a complete novice, can.

# Similarities and Differences
These are 

Yet there are important differences between Programming hardware through Lisp and Programming wetware through Sanskrit. These are to do with differences in how people learn versus how machines learn. People learn sysenthetically - through a combination of all senses including sound, vision, motion. I don't know if one is more advanced the other, but at this point, Sanskrit seems to beat any other computer-based method wof computation, because it does not *demand* availability of external resources as necessarry prerequisite in order to generate computational processes.

Procedures *are* Formulae and vice verca. Or imperative and procedural definitions are indistinguishable.


[1] Apocryphically, the creators of Sanskrit intended IT to be such an all-encompassing framework. Perhaps Lispers dream of such things for IT too.

[2] Some may notice how the shloka itself hints at the scope of tests one's ideas must pass to be deemed fit for consumption:
 * The role of philosophical clarity: In order to remain open to new ideas, or to understand things deeply, or to solve problems thoroughly, or to argue one's case well etc.
 * The use of the power of language: The word "shuka" means a mindless parrot as well as a sagacious genius. This shloka, like all shlokas, 
 * The stress on logical and empiricical value of the idea itself regardless of its source


[3] Note for Free Software enthusiasts as well as Agnostics: You will enjoy the notion that the authors of the Vedas intended to progressively capture all human knowledge and make it timeless, accessible to, and verifiable by _any_ interested being. Several branches were created, forked, changed, merged, trashed over several generations of atheistic and agnostic Vedic authors several millenia ago. And none of them signed any of those texts by their own names or their schools of thought. Note the implicit mechanism of freeing information/knowledge: If no person or organization is recognized in the creation or modification of intellectual output, it implicitly means rejection of the idea of exclusive ownership and the very notion of property. Therefore it also removes the need to create any further mechanism, like terms of use or licenses, to force others to follow suit. So if you like this text, go wild and do as you please with it. But remember what comes of it may matter only if it can be validated, not because it came from I or you.

[4] I don't know who the good fellow was, but let's assume he was the *almost* unassailable amalgamation of McCarthy, Einstein, Darwin, DaVinci, and [D-named philosopher]. "Almost" because, being only human, he could still be wrong.
