Starting documentation of my SICP study.

# File naming convention

Filenames starting with "ch" are chapter examples, typed for practice.
e.g. ch1-1-7-square-roots.scm is the study in Chapter 1.1.7, 
of calculating square roots with Newton's successive approximation method.

Filenames starting with "ex" are my attempts to solve exercise problems.
e.g. ex1-01-read-and-eval-expressions.scm
